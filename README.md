# Ameemos
A responsive virtual pet game utilizing Flask.

## Status: In Development
My vision for this game is to relive my love of virtual pet games from the days of old, but with a slightly modern twist. I want to engage users from the moment they first load up the page.

At the moment, all you will see upon loading this app will be a hastily drawn egg and two hastily drawn buttons. But I have big dreams for this project, and big dreams often have humble beginnings.

## Installation
Via Git Bash:

`git clone https://github.com/tiffanystallings/pet-project.git`

## Requirements
* Python 2
* Flask
* Flask-SQLAlchemy

## Usage
This app is handled by a Flask application, so in order to get it running you will need to run the views.py file.

1. Using your preferred CLI, navigate to the pet-project/app folder.
2. Call Python to open the views.py file. `python views.py`
3. Open your preferred broswer and navigate to: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
4. You should see an image of an egg and two buttons. Clicking on the egg will make it wobble.

## Contributions
This project is still in it's infancy (one could say it hasn't yet... hatched... ahaha haha ha...), so I won't take any direct code contributions until I know what areas need fleshed out. However, any feedback is welcomed though taking out an issue.
